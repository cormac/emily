Infrastructure:
Add a repl for the server : for debugging purposes


Tasks:
- Add a message saying that another X people are needed for the game


With more time:
- for now only the first 4 people logging in will get a spot. If any of the
  warriors logs off, their position will not be available and we will have to 
  stop the game. A solution for this would be to keep their positions in the 
  array and add logic to add other people when one of them is off.
- There are a couple of reconnection events in the client API that can be used
  for this too (but won't look into that for now).

Limitations:
When one user logs off, it's better to close all client and start up again.
