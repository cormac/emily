Forged Cavalier frontend

Cavalier:
--------
The cavalier listens for keypresses on a, s, and d key
He will then emit an event related to that keypress
a: 'shield attack'
s: 'sword attack'
d: 'mace attack'

The other players can then defend the attack
This defence will emit an event that gets picked up the cavalier. If the defence 
is successful 'attack blocked' event will fire
if not, '<attack type> success' will fire

Custom Events are being triggered and caught using the eventemitter library
https://github.com/Wolfy87/EventEmitter

ToDo:
Implement animations and display for the cavalier
Integrate Cavalier events with node backend

Warrior:
--------

Nothing done so far - 
Warrior will need to emit events in much the same way as the Cavalier

Event Integration:
------------------
We will need to pass the events via node between clients
